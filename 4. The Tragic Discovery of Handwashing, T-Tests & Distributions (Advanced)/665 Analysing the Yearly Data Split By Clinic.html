This is what puzzled and frustrated Dr Semmelweis. </p><p><br></p><p><strong>The story continues...</strong></p><p>At first, Dr Semmelweis thought that the position of the women giving birth was the issue. In clinic 2, the midwives' clinic, women gave birth on their sides. In the doctors' clinic, women gave birth on their backs. So, Dr. Semmelweis, had women in the doctors' clinic give birth on their sides. However, this had no effect on the death rate. </p><p>Next, Dr Semmelweis noticed that whenever someone on the ward died, a priest would walk through clinic 1, past the women's beds ringing a bell ðŸ””. Perhaps the priest and the bell ringing terrified the women so much after birth that they developed a fever, got sick and died. Dr Semmelweis had the priest change his route and stop ringing the bell ðŸ”•. Again, this had no effect. </p><p>At this point, Dr Semmelweis was so frustrated he went on holiday to Venice. Perhaps a short break would clear his head. When Semmelweis returned from his vacation, he was told that one of his colleagues, a pathologist, had fallen ill and died. His friend had pricked his finger while doing an autopsy on a woman who had died from childbed fever and subsequently got very sick himself and died. ðŸ˜®</p><p>Looking at the pathologist's symptoms, Semmelweis realised the pathologist died from the same thing as the women he had autopsied.&nbsp; This was his breakthrough: anyone could get sick from childbed fever, not just women giving birth! </p><p>This is what led to Semmelweis' new theory. Perhaps there were little pieces or particles of a corpse that the doctors and medical students were getting on their hands while dissecting the cadavers during an autopsy. And when the doctors delivered the babies in clinic 1, these particles would get inside the women giving birth who would then develop the disease and die.</p></p></div></div></div></body></html>
